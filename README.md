# PA CLUBS
### A CSC630 final project by Nalu Concepcion and Liv MÃ¤rtens

You can find our project [here](http://pa-clubs.herokuapp.com/).
## Explanation
This is an application developed for Andover students to check when certain clubs are meeting and who is attending these meetings. Certain users can create new clubs and everyone can access a list of clubs, their meeting times and the attendees.
## How to use
Simply go to http://pa-clubs.herokuapp.com and sign up with your Andover email. You can log in immediately, see all the clubs and !
## Security Audit
Right now everyone can sign up, no matter whether they are a PA student or not. They also don't have to confirm that the email-address they entered is correct. This would be one of the first things to fix.
